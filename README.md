# PI-TPDNet
A PHYSICS-INFORMED TREND-PERIOD DECOMPOSITION NEURAL NETWORK FOR AIR QUALITY PREDICTION

We use two publicly available datasets as described in the paper:
1. **KnowAir**: https://github.com/shuowang-ai/PM2.5-GNN
2. **Airware-Haikou**: https://zenodo.org/records/15379915
     

The code used in this work, corresponding to our ICASSP 2026 paper, will be made publicly available upon publication.
